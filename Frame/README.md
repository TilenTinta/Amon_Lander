Amon Lander - Frame

The enire frame was inspired by BPS sprite drone but with my ideas and modifications. Entire drone is available is STL and STEP file format and can be 3D printed on clasic FDM 3D printer. For the first version of drone i used XPETG but then i switched to LW-PLA to decrease the weight. None on the frames was not been tested in air to that moments.
Everything was designed in Autodesk Fusion 360 (Hobbyist/Personal Use licence)
