Amon Lander - LED board

Everyone knows that no project is correctly done without some LEDs. For that case the drone uses small PCBs with two LED lights (red and white) that light accordingly with the state of drone. They are mounted at the end of landing legs and top pipes. Even thou they include hole and can be screwd in the holder the gluing is more recomended
