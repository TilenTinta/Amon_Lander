# Amon Lander — Lander/Hopper (Frame, Electronics & Software)

**Project Status:** In Progress

**Short description:** An open‑source EDF‑hovering lander/hopper inspired by **Sprite** (BPS.space), built end‑to‑end for learning: frame, electronics, firmware, software, and documentation.

## Overview

Amon Lander is an educational lander/hopper platform designed to demonstrate vertical takeoff/landing and attitude control with thrust‑vectoring fins. The project emphasizes **building everything from scratch** and using mostly **free maker‑friendly tools**.

---

## System Concept

- **Propulsion:** Single **EDF fan** for hover.  
- **Control:** **Four servos** driving fins for stabilization (**TVC**).  
- **Sensing:** Onboard sensors monitor flight parameters.  
- **Flight Computer:** **Custom PCB** handles computation and comms with the ground computer.  
- **Ground Segment:** Desktop app for **monitoring and control**.

> The core goal is to learn: electronics, 3D modeling, embedded/desktop software, reading documentation, flight mechanics, and control theory—while having fun. Many things could be done faster or simpler, but this project favors learning and exploration.

## Hardware

### Frame

The frame is inspired by Sprite, with custom ideas and modifications. The entire airframe is provided in **STL** and **STEP** and is printable on a standard **FDM** printer.  
- Early prototypes used **XPETG**; later versions used **LW‑PLA** to reduce weight.  
- Frames shown here are **not yet flight‑tested**.  
- Designed in **Autodesk Fusion 360 (Personal Use license)**.

### LED Boards

Compact PCBs with two LEDs (**red** and **white**) indicate system state. They mount on the leg ends and top tubes. Although each LED board has a screw hole, **adhesive is recommended** for attachment.

## Getting Started

### Print & Materials

- Slice **STL** parts per your printer’s capabilities.  
- Recommended filaments:
  - **LW‑PLA** (weight savings) or **PETG/XPETG** (durability).  
- Orient parts to maximize strength along load paths (legs, fins, mounts).

### Assembly Notes

- Dry‑fit major components before final fastening/adhesive.  
- Verify servo travel and linkage geometry with power **off** first.  
- Route wiring to avoid EDF ingestion and moving fin linkages.  

---

## Calibration & Testing

- Bench‑test **sensors** and **servo directions** before powering the EDF.  
- Perform staged tests: electronics bring‑up → servo only → tethered hover.  
- Log telemetry and review for oscillations; tune control gains incrementally.  

---

## Roadmap

- Refine frame geometry and weight distribution.  
- Expand build and calibration documentation.  
- Integrate tighter loops with **Amon Board** firmware and **Amon Link**.  
- Tethered hovers → free flight milestones.

---

## Status & Disclaimer

**In active development.** Designs and documents are evolving; expect changes and rough edges. Exercise caution when testing EDF propulsion and keep bystanders at a safe distance.
