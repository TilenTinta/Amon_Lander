# Amon Lander 

**Project Status:** In Progress

Amon Lander is an open-source lander/hopper inspired by the **Sprite** vehicle created by Joe Barnard from the BPS.space YouTube channel.

Everything has been built from the ground up—frame, electronics, firmware, and software. Most tools and programs used are free and widely available to makers.

## Concept

- Uses an **EDF fan** to hover.
- **Four servos + fins** for stabilization (TVC).
- **Sensors** to monitor flight parameters.
- **Custom PCB** handles computation and communications with a ground computer.
- **Ground app** for monitoring and control.

The main goal is to learn as much as possible about **electronics**, **3D modeling**, **embedded and desktop software**, **datasheets and documentation**, **flight mechanics**, and **control theory**—and to have fun along the way. Many things could be done faster and simpler, but the point of this project is learning.

## Additional Repositories

This project was originally a single repository, but due to complexity it is now split across multiple repos:

- **Amon Lander (this repo):** frame, test and control software, data.
- **[Amon Board][amon-board]:** flight controllers and firmware.
- **[Amon Link][amon-link]:** PC–drone communication (PCB and firmware).
- **[Amon Ground Control][amon-gcs]:** PC software for communicating with the drone.
