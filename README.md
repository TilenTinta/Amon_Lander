As a space enthusiast, fan of space technology and technology in general 
I was always impresed by rockets and setelites. To these day I am still 
amazed by self landing rockets. Sooo... the best thing to learn a lot of details 
is from book, internet and to make my own self landing rocket. 
From that idea I started these project. His model was a base idea to create 
Amon but I wanted to make it my way.

Everithing was created from ground up (frame, electronics, firmware, programs...). 
All the tools and programs used (at least most of them) are free and are available to
any maker these days.

The plan was/is to create craft similar to Sprite that uses EDF fan to hover, four
servos and fins to stabilize itself (TVC), sensors to monitor all the parameters, 
custom PCB to do all computation and communications with computer on the grond. 
Everything will be monitored and controlled from an app.
