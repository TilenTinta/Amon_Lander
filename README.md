by Joe Barnard from YouTube channel BPS.space.

Everithing was created from ground up (frame, electronics, firmware, programs...). 
All the tools and programs used (at least most of them) are free and are available to
any maker these days.

The plan was/is to create craft similar to Sprite that uses EDF fan to hover, four
servos and fins to stabilize itself (TVC), sensors to monitor all the parameters, 
custom PCB to do all computation and communications with computer on the grond. 
Everything will be monitored and controlled from an app.
