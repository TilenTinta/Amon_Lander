Amon Lander - Firmware

Flight controler (only MCU version) uses STM32F405RGT6-LQFP64. All firmware, including almost all drivers, were written from scratch with the purpose of learning and familiarizing myself with electronics and its documentation
The code, especially in the drivers, may contain some error!

*Code works and is still in development but it will be ported to a newer version of flight controller.
